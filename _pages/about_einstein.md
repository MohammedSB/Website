My name is Mohammed Baharoon and I am currently interested in self-supervised learning, representation learning, and multimodal learning applied to medicine and biology, with an emphasis on computer vision and large foundation models. I am currently a Fatima Fellow working with Dr. Wei Peng. I have previously worked at King Abdullah International Medical Research Center with Prof. Abdulrhman Aljoue.
