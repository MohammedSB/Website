Hello! I am currently a master's student at Harvard Medical School studying Biomedical Informatics, with a focus on Machine Learning for Health. I am interested in self-supervised learning, representation learning, and multimodal learning applied to medicine and biology, with emphasis on computer vision and large foundation models. I was previously a research intern with Bo Wang at the Vector Institue, with Dominik L. Michels at KAUST, and with Abdulrhman Aljoue at King Abdullah International Medical Research Center.
